                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    Naruto Shippuden, Dragonball Z & One Piece.
                    Of these "Big Name" three, Naruto Shippuden has always been my favorte one. In that same order
                    mentioned, is the seriousness of these anime in my opinion. All three anime have a
                    deep storyline and serious undertone but One Piece (in my opinion) has way more comedy than
                    the other two. DBZ has the same serious tone but with "stretched out" battles
                    and noticeable patterns, Naruto Shippuden got the edge over DBZ in my book.
                    Naruto Shippuden (in my opinion) has a beautiful blend of comedy, action, seriousness
                    & drama.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    This anime is packed with action and the fight choreoraphy is awesome. The moments of
                    humor do not last very long in this anime, as the serious undertone is always present.
                    Even while in highschool the weight of the world is on the shoulders of the protagonists.
                    Journey with the young protagonist Izuku, as he inherits the power of the world's greatest hero
                    but also bares the burden of becoming a symbol of piece for the world in an increasing dark time.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    Imagine a world where the threat of man eating Giants are ever present.
                    This is by all means a serious anime because how the fight against the
                    giants is portrayed.
                    How does mankind fight against man eating giants in a somewhat insudtrial
                    era without stuff like mechs or futuristic tech, but only their own ingenuity
                    and steel. This is the setting in this action packed and thrilling anime.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    Action packed and really well choreographed fights are the things I would mention
                    if someone were to ask me, what immdediately comes to mind when I think of this anime.
                    The main protaganist definitely has a chip on his shoulder, as he is constantly reminded
                    after each battle that he is nowhere near powerful enough and needs to work harder.
                    But dispite that, he continues to walk the path towards vengance for his family.

                <hr class="divider">
                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    This is one serious anime. There are a few "slice of life moments" in the anime,
                    but ever increasing threats in the form of "waves" seem to always be just around the corner.
                    Each wave is more dangerous aand requires our protagonist to keep getting stronger, to the
                    point where he has choose between a dark power or relying on his friends an party to be
                    strong enough to defeat the waves.
                    If you like sword art online, then you'll probably like this anime.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    This is also a serious anime with a little of a slice of life vibe as well.
                    By now you're probably noticing that I like really good fight choreoraphy in anime.
                    And this anime has a ton of them.
