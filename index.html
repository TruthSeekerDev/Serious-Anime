                <hr class="divider">
                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    Itâ€™s the sequel to the popular NARUTO anime that many fans know of; the journey of a young boy (Naruto), who is ostracized by fellow villagers for holding within his body, a demon that once rampaged through their village. He trains hard to control the power within and become the hero that the village needs. <br/>
                    NARUTO SHIPPUDEN continues the journey of Naruto, who is now a teenager. He trains hard as he did before, to control his power and save not just his village but the entire ninja world. He must also survive a deadly organization, who seeks to rip from his body, the power within him and even more dangerous threats that seek to control the entire world.

                    This anime is packed with action and the fight choreoraphy is awesome. The moments of
                    humor do not last very long in this anime, as the serious undertone is always present.
                    Even while in highschool the weight of the world is on the shoulders of the protagonists (The students of UA).
                    Journey with the main protagonist Izuku, as he inherits the power of the world's greatest hero
                    but also bares the burden of becoming a symbol of piece for the world in an increasing dark time.

                    Imagine a world where the threat of man eating Giants are ever present.
                    This is by all means a serious anime because how the fight against the
                    giants is portrayed.
                    How does mankind fight against man eating giants in a somewhat insudtrial
                    era, without stuff like mechs or futuristic tech, but only their ingenuity,
                    and steel (blades)! This is the setting in this action packed and thrilling anime.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    Action packed and really well choreographed fights are the things I would mention
                    if someone were to ask me, what immdediately comes to mind when I think of this anime.
                    Even the sound effect are exceptional (in my opinion). <br/>
                    The main protaganist definitely has a chip on his shoulder, as he is constantly reminded
                    after each battle that he is nowhere near powerful enough and needs to work harder.
                    But dispite that, he continues to walk the path towards vengance for his family and ultimately rid the world of demons.

                <p class="AnimeDiscription">
                    In this Isekai anime, our main protagonist is summoned to an unfamiliar world to be one of it's heroes.
                    But he's treated poorly simply because he succeeds the previous Shield Hero.
                    Ironically our main protagonist becomes their best hope for ever increasing threats in the form of "waves".
                    Each new wave is more dangerous and requires our protagonist to keep getting stronger, to the
                    point where he has to choose between a dark power or relying on his friends and party to be
                    strong enough to defeat the waves.

                    In the final season of this anime, it became hype and awesomeness incarnate. In my opinion, 
                    the final season was really well made, I want to say exceptional but must remain unbaised. 
                    The animation and fight choreography is great. The visual effects and even sound effects are really awesome. 
                    If you have surround sound, you will feel immersed this anime. <br/>
                    But the story follows Kazuto Kirigaya (Or JP; Kirigaya Kazuto), gamer and beta tester, known in the gaming world as Kirito.
                    Kirito repeatedly saves lives of endangered players by solving real crises (and crimes really) that are created via
                    Virtual Reality Mass Multiplayer Online games, or VRMMO as the anime calls them. Like players being trapped in a WRMMO,
                    which leaves them in a commatose state.
